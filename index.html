  <p id="lstory"> The girls were out partying one night. Meg noticed she forgot her purse and went back quickly to the dorm. </p>
  <p id="lstory"> Without turning on the lights she walked in and grabbed the purse. Then she returned to the party. </p>
  <p id="lstory"> Later on in the night, Venida got tired. She left to the dorm to go to sleep. </p>
  <p id="lstory"> The next morning, Meg went back to the dorm. The police officers were outside. </p>
  <p id="lstory"> ” Officer, what’s the problem?” She asked. </p>
  <p id="lstory"> ” There has been a murderer.” </p>
  <p id="lstory"> ” Oh my god. Please let me see.” </p>
  <p id="lstory"> “No. It’s a bit to sloppy.” Said the officer. </p>
  <p id="lstory"> “Please.” Finally, the officer let Venida upstairs. </p>
  <p id="lstory"> When she walked in the room she saw her roomate covered with a clean white sheet. </p>
  <p id="lstory"> On the mirror in big, red letters words said: </p> 
  <p id="red"> ” AREN’T YOU GLAD YOU DIDN’T TURN ON THE LIGHT?” </p>
